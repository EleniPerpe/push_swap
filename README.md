push_swap is a sorting program designed to sort a list of integers using a set of specific operations on two stacks, a and b. The program takes a list of integers as input (representing stack a) and outputs the shortest sequence of instructions needed to sort the stack in ascending order using the smallest number of operations. The operations available for sorting are based on stack manipulation commands such as sa, pb, ra, and others.

In this implementation, the Radix Sort algorithm is used to sort the stack, focusing on minimizing the number of operations to achieve the sorted order.
